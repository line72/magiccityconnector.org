# Where?

The proposed location is to initially connect downtown Homewood to 5
Points South by going over Red Mountain. A stop will be located in
downtown Homewood, Vulcan Park on Red Mountain, and then 5 Points
South.  The Magic City Connector could then continue down 20th Street
with stops near the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Rail Road
Park, the Financial District, and finally terminating at the BJCC
adjacent to the new Entertainment District that is under construction.
