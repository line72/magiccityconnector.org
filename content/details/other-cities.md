# Other Cities

There are many cities around the world that have gondola lifts.  Below
are some that are urban gondola lifts through a major city that link
with public transportation.

## Medellín, Columbia

Medellín, Columbia currently has the most advanced, integrated gondola
lift system built into their public transit system.  As part of their
metro system, the MetroCable system connects regions of the city that
were never able to be connected before.  This has allowed drastic
transformations of neighborhoods around the city.

A fantastic write up the system, city, and transformations can be read
on the [Gondola Project
blog](http://gondolaproject.com/2010/03/11/medellincaracas-part-1/). More
information can be found on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrocable_(Medell%C3%ADn)).

## Caracas, Venezuela

Not to be out done be Medellín, Caracas too has recently opened an
urban gondola lift as part of its public transit system. More details
