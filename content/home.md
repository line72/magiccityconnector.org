# What?

The *Magic City Connector* is a new idea for public transportation in
Birmingham, AL. By utilizing a cable car, or gondola lift, we can make
public transportation between popular hot spots fun, convenient, and
affordable.

# Where?

The proposed location is to initially connect downtown Homewood to 5
Points South by going over Red Mountain. A stop will be located in
downtown Homewood, Vulcan Park on Red Mountain, and then 5 Points
South.  The Magic City Connector could then continue down 20th Street
with stops near the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Rail Road
Park, the Financial District, and finally terminating at the BJCC
adjacent to the new Entertainment District that is under construction.

# Why?

On the south side of downtown Birmingham sits Red Mountain.  Red
Mountain is a physical barrier keeping the great communities of
downtown from connecting with those just south of downtown. Both
downtown Homewood and 5 Points South are exciting, walkable areas, and
while the distance between the two is short, all pedestrian traffic is
impeded by Red Mountain.  The Magic City Connector would bring
together these two great communities in both a fun and efficient
manner.
